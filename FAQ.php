                        <div class="p">Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be at least 17 years old. In Minnesota, 16-years-olds may donate with written consent from a parent or guardian. During your donation appointment, you will complete a brief health questionnaire to make sure blood donation is safe for you and the recipient of your blood.</div>

                    <div class="h5">How much blood is taken?</div>
                    <div class="p">For a whole blood donation, approximately 500 ml or one-half liter of blood is collected. For donations of other blood products, 
                    such as platelet or plasma, the amount collected depends on your height, weight and platelet count.</div>

                    <div class="h5">Why are there often blood shortages?</div>
                    <div class="p">Most blood centers strive to maintain an optimum inventory level of a three-day supply. Due to unpredictable demands for trauma patients, the inventory fluctuates hourly. When the blood supply drops below a 
                    three-day level, blood centers begin alerting local donors to increase the inventory to a safe operating level.</div>

                <li>
                    <div class="h5">What types of tests are performed on donated blood?</div>
                    <div class="p">After blood is drawn, it is tested for ABO group (blood type) and Rh type (positive or negative), 
                    as well as for any unexpected red blood cell antibodies that may cause problems for the transfusion recipient. 
                    Blood is tested for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hepatitis B virus</li>
                        <li>Hepatitis C virus</li>
                        <li>HIV-1 and HIV-2</li>
                        <li>HTLV-I and HTLV-II</li>
                        <li>Syphilis</li>

                <li>
                    <div class="h5">Can I donate if I have recently had a vaccination?</div>
                    <div class="p">Donation is acceptable following most vaccinations as long as you are feeling well. Donors vaccinated for chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella and smallpox or who have received the oral polio vaccine must wait two to four weeks after vaccination.</div>
