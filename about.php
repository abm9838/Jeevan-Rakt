                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood you donate gives someone another chance at life. One day that 
                someone may be a close relative, a friend, a loved one or even you. Being a human, 
                we must help other humans and tell other humans for humanity. We must make a loud 
                message for the whole world that â€œHumanity still exists in us! </p>

                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we help to colaborate between doners and people who need blood, so that it becomes 
                easier to find blood.The best part of the blood donation is you will get blessings of the person,
                 to whom your blood will be useful. One more thing is that one donorâ€™s blood can be used by 3 to 4 
                 patients, as the blood is divided into various useful components. So, you actually save more than 
                 one life by only one-time blood donation</p>
